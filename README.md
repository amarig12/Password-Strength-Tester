<h1>Password Strength Tester</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This Python script helps users create strong passwords. It performs two key functions:

Password Strength Assessment:</p>

- <b>The script prompts the user to enter a password.</b>
- <b>It analyzes the password's strength based on criteria like length, character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and avoids simple patterns.</b>
- <b>The script provides feedback indicating password strength (e.g., weak, okay, strong).</b>



<p>Common Password Check:</p>

- <b>The script compares the entered password against a list of common passwords loaded from a text file.</b>
- <b>If the password matches a common password, the script immediately terminates, preventing its use and prompting the user to create a more secure one.</b>
- <b>This script promotes good password hygiene by encouraging users to set strong and unique passwords, reducing the risk of account compromise.</b>
